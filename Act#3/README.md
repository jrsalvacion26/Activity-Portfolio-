1. Global Variables:
+ potPin, thermistorPin, ldrPin, buzzerPin:
   * These store the pins where the potentiometer, thermistor, LDR, and buzzer are connected to the microcontroller (likely an Arduino).
*potValue, tempValue, lightValue, temperatureThreshold:
* + These store the analog readings from the potentiometer, thermistor, and LDR, as well as the calculated temperature threshold.
