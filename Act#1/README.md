#Code Explanation:

1. int timer = 1000;
First item Initializes a variable timer to store the delay duration (in milliseconds).
-The value 1000 means a 1-second delay.

setup() function:
-Configures digital pins 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 as output pins
-This pins will be used to control external devices (like LEDs or relays).

loop() function:
-The loop() function runs continuously after the setup() function is executed.

The sequence inside loop():

-Turns on each of the output pins (10, 9, 8, 7, and 6) one by one, with a 1-second delay between each.

-After turning on each pin, it waits for 1 second (delay(timer)).

-Then it turns off the same pins, with a similar 1-second delay after each pin is turned off.
