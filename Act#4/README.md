# Code Explanation 


1. Global Variables:
* ledPin: Specifies the pin number where the LED is connected (in this case, pin 13).
threshold: Sets the light intensity level that will trigger the LED blinking. If the light input is greater than or equal to this value, the LED will start blinking.
* shouldBlink: A boolean variable that determines whether the LED should blink. It is initially set to false.

2. setup() Function:
* pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT): Configures the LED pin as an output so it can control the LED (turn it on or off).
* Serial.begin(9600): Starts serial communication at a baud rate of 9600, allowing the Arduino to send and receive data over the Serial Monitor.

2. loop() Function:
+ Light Sensor Reading:

    * int rawBrightness = analogRead(A0): Reads the raw value from the analog pin A0, which is connected to a light sensor (like a photoresistor). The value will range from 0 to 1023, where 0 is no light and 1023 is the maximum brightness.
    * int brightness = map(rawBrightness, 0, 1023, 0, 255): Maps the raw brightness value (ranging from 0-1023) to a more manageable range (0-255). This value represents the mapped brightness level of the sensor.

+ Serial Output:
    * Serial.print("Mapped Brightness Level: ") and Serial.println(brightness): Prints the mapped brightness level to the Serial Monitor so the user can observe the sensorâ€™s reading in real-time.

+ Brightness Check and LED Blinking:

    * if (brightness >= threshold): Compares the brightness value to the threshold. If the brightness is equal to or greater than the threshold (indicating enough light), it sets shouldBlink = true, signaling that the LED should blink.
    * if (shouldBlink): If shouldBlink is true (meaning the brightness was high enough), the LED starts blinking:
        * digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH): Turns the LED on (sets the ledPin to HIGH).
        * delay(100): Waits for 100 milliseconds, keeping the LED on for a brief moment.
        * digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW): Turns the LED off (sets the ledPin to LOW).
        * delay(100): Waits for another 100 milliseconds, keeping the LED off for the same amount of time. This creates a blinking effect.

+ Serial Command to Stop Blinking:

    * if (Serial.available() > 0): Checks if there's data available from the Serial Monitor (i.e., if the user has typed something and pressed Enter).

    * String input = Serial.readString(): Reads the incoming serial data as a string.

    * input.trim(): Removes any leading or trailing spaces from the input string.

    * Stop Command:

        * if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("stop")): If the input string equals "stop" (case insensitive), it:
            * Sets shouldBlink = false, stopping the LED from blinking.
            * Turns the LED off by calling digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW).
